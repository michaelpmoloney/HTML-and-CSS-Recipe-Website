		<h2>The Rundown:</h2>
		<p class="recipepara">10 min Prep Time<br>19 min Cook Time<br>29 min Total Time<br>Makes Four Servings</p>
		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul class="recipepara">
			<li>2 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
			<li>1 (11 ounce) bottle red Thai curry sauce </li>
			<li>(16 ounce) package skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into small cubes</li>
			<li>1/2 (16 ounce) package dried rice stick vermicelli noodles</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Directions:</h2>
		<ol class="recipepara">
			<li>Heat oil in a large skillet on high heat. Add chicken cubes; cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Reduce heat to medium-high and add coconut cream and curry sauce. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
			<li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain. </li>
			<li>Reduce skillet heat to simmer. Add the noodles and let simmer until flavors are absorbed, about 5 minutes. Divide chicken and noodles among individual serving bowls. </li>
